# How to Handover

For some of you, it will be a relief to fling off this extra overcommitment and focus on exams. For some, it's a little too devastating moving on. Either way, help the next exec out by writing down everything you wished you'd known. It doesn't have to take more than 10 minutes, or it can take 3 hours, either way, something is better than nothing. More information is (usually) better than less because people can choose what to read and what to avoid. It means the club can continue to grow and improve each year, instead of losing institutional knowledge.

Best practice for handovers is to write them as you go through your year, as one can be surprised at how much you can forget! It's also good to give access to all previous documents one worked on over the course of the year because this can also help paint a picture. You should give access to a written document straight after the AGM for the new club executive to read and offer to meet in person to answer any questions they may have. But, if you don't have time for that, anything is better than nothing.

## Role Summary
Start with why the role exists, and explain it like the person has no prior knowledge of the role, and briefly outline a list of essential duties to this role. It can be very useful to put a rough expectation of the time commitment here.

## Working in an Exec
Learning how to work effectively in a team is one of the most rewarding, and critical skills one can learn from being involved in clubs on campus. Each exec has a different dynamic and people need to bring different skills to the table. This can be a good thing to put in handovers to mitigate the likelihood of interpersonal conflict.

## Breakdown of Key Tasks
This will change a lot depending on the role, but break down what needs to happen, why, how and when. The more detail, the easier it will be for people to learn.

## What I wish I'd Known
Is there anything that would have been nice to know before you started? Save someone else from additional stress and trial by fire. Anything with key skills you would have liked can go here ie. â€“ how to take minutes, or budget. Please feel free to link/refer to any resources on the Clubs section of the ANUSA website too.

## What I did Well, What I would Improve
It can be good to reflect on what went well, and what could have been changed. This section should be more anecdotal, and acknowledge that with changing circumstances, this advice doesn't always carry. But, the more information, the better.

## Resources You Need
This can be either attached at the end or integrated through the handover. It's useful to have links to external resources ie. important parts of the ANUSA website as well as:

*   All club documents (hardcopy/digital)
*   Financial records and bank access details
*   A copy of the club constitution
*   Previous meeting minutes
*   Important contact details
*   The member list (even though you'll create a new one)
*   Contact details of important people
*   Society calendar of events
*   All club property
*   Information about the society's files, Facebook page, website, Qpay, mailboxes etc. (This includes passwords and usernames)

## Ongoing Responsibilities and Loose Ends
*   If you were halfway through a really cool project let your new exec know.
*   Especially if you were in contact with external stakeholders, it can be very good to send an email to them to introduce them to the person replacing you.
*   If you have any past sponsorship details, past events or any ongoing obligations and problems, it is worth putting them here.

## Conclusion
Add any other thoughts you have about your role. If you are happy to be contacted with questions this can be a really nice place to mention that!
