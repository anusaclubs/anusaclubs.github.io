### **2025 Mid-Year Funding Snapshot: Club Funding Shows Unprecedented Growth and Demand**
*By Harrison Oates, 2025 ANUSA Clubs Officer*

As we cross the halfway point of the year, it's time to check in on the financial heartbeat of our vibrant club community. Our clubs and societies are more active than ever, hosting a huge range of events and initiatives that enrich campus life. This incredible energy is reflected directly in the grant funding data, which shows a dramatic surge in activity compared to this time last year.

This analysis compares the period of **1st December 2023 – 28th June 2024** with **1st December 2024 – 28th June 2025**, corresponding to Semester 1 of 2024 and 2025, respectively. 
I demonstrate that demand for club funding has skyrocketed, largely driven by increased event activity and a growing number of clubs.

### **How Are Clubs Spending?**

To understand the big picture, we first need to look at the details. The table below breaks down spending by grant category. Because some grants paid out in 2025 were approved in late 2024, I've included an "Adjusted % Change" column to provide the most accurate year-over-year comparison.

| Category | 2024 Count | 2024 Spend | 2025 Count | 2025 Spend | Original % Change | Adjusted % Change | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CapEx** | 24 | $1,952.80 | 20 | $2,043.98 | 4.67% | **-17.86%** | *$439.98 of 2025 spend approved in 2024 (2 grants)* |
| **Joint** | 19 | $6,070.77 | 13 | $6,946.99 | 14.43% | — | |
| **Merch** | 9 | $1,756.71 | 13 | $2,379.09 | 35.43% | **-16.08%** | *$904.86 of 2025 spend approved in 2024 (2 grants)* |
| **Operational**| 1 | $89.98 | 3 | $463.45 | 415.06% | — | |
| **Ordinary** | 490 | $81,077.53 | 683 | $124,248.58| 53.25% | **46.53%** | *$5,445.87 of 2025 spend approved in 2024 (31 grants)*|
| **Special** | 3 | $951.08 | 6 | $3,294.68 | 246.41% | **226.54%** | *$189.04 of 2025 spend approved in 2024 (1 grant)* |
| **Travel** | 3 | $2,322.31 | 4 | $490.49 | -78.88% | — | |
| **Liquid/Startup**| 12 | $2,200.00 | 15 | $3,000.00 | 36.36% | — | *Now only for newly affiliated clubs* |
| **Inclusive** | 0 | $0.00 | 1 | $120.00 | — | — ||
| **Handover** | 0 | $0.00 | 4 | $200.00 | — | — | *New grant type in 2025* |

#### **Summary of Findings**

1.  **Adjusted Spending Reveals Downturns:** After adjusting for funds that were approved in 2024 but paid in 2025, the **CapEx** and **Merch** categories show significant decreases of **-17.86%** and **-16.08%** respectively, contrary to their initial apparent growth. This indicates a true reduction in spending for these areas in 2025.
2.  **Major Growth Areas:** **Special** and **Operational** grants saw the largest percentage increases. Even after adjustments, Special grant spending grew by a substantial **226.54%**. Operational spending shows a very high percentage growth, though it comes from a low initial value.
3.  **Ordinary Grants Remain a Key Driver:** While the adjusted growth for Ordinary grants (**46.53%**) is lower than the initial figure, it still represents the largest single area of expenditure increase in absolute dollar terms.
4.  **Significant Decrease in Travel:** Travel grant spending has fallen sharply by **-78.88%**, marking the most significant reduction across all categories. This is likely due to a shift in grant interpretation which focusses on covering transport costs rather than broader travel expenses.

### **The Big Picture: Overall Budget Performance**

While the category breakdown is insightful, it is clear that the overall spend tells a clear story of accelerated demand. The table below summarizes total funding approved by June 28th for both years. The "Adjusted %" for 2025 also shows where we stand against the expected, larger budget of $230,000, to be passed at OGM2.

| Period | Funding Approved | Grants Processed | Total Annual Budget | Funding % of Year (Budgeted) | Adjusted % of Budget (on $230k) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2024 to 28th June** | $96,421.18 | 531 | $190,000 | 50.75% | — |
| **2025 to 28th June** | $143,187.26 | 764 | $200,000 | 71.59% | **62.26%** |

### **Conclusion**

The year-over-year comparison paints a stark picture: demand for club funding is skyrocketing. By the same point in the year, **48.50% more funding has been distributed** for **43.88% more grants** than in 2024.

This has put unprecedented pressure on the annual budget. Last year, we had used just over half the budget by now (50.75%). This year, we have already approved nearly three-quarters of the current budget (71.59%). Even when measured against a potential increased budget of $230,000, our spending rate (62.26%) is still far ahead of last year's pace.

The data shows that our clubs are more successful and active than ever - a fantastic problem to have. However, it also reveals that this growth is straining our traditional, SSAF-based funding model.
This trend strongly suggests that the adequacy of our base funding needs to be reassessed to match the community's new level of ambition. It is more vital than ever that the clubs community bands together to help find sponsors for the Sponsored Pool.
