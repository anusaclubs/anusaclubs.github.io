# Tools ANUSA has built
In 2025, ANUSA introduced a number of new tools to help improve transparency of the clubs program.

## Live Statistics
The [ANUSA Clubs Statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16na3I2hSBcOZBMbfsA7mxSwPZyxUIv5t7-xQdixo0LM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) page provides a live view of the clubs program, including:
- Clubs and societies affiliated with ANUSA
- Funding allocated per club
- Number of events run by each club, and
- Statistics on club engagement.

## Clubs Calendar
The [Clubs Calendar](https://anusa.com.au/clubs/events/) allows students to see all upcoming events run by clubs and societies affiliated with ANUSA. This calendar is updated in real-time as clubs create Rubric events.

# Clubs Committee
The Clubs Committee contributes to the on-going development and growth of the ANUSA Clubs program, namely by:
1. assisting with reform and development of rules governing clubs;
2. managing initiatives to foster collaboration; and
3. running training or other events to foster development among club leaders
