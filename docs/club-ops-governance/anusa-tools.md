# Tools ANUSA has Built
To improve transparency and help drive event engagement, ANUSA has developed several tools for clubs to use.

## Live Statistics
The [ANUSA Clubs Statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16na3I2hSBcOZBMbfsA7mxSwPZyxUIv5t7-xQdixo0LM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) page provides a live, data-driven view of the clubs program. You can use this resource to find:

- A list of all clubs and societies currently affiliated with ANUSA.
- The total funding allocated to each club.
- The number of events run by each club.
- Historical statistics on club engagement to assist in event planning.

## Clubs Calendar
The [Clubs Calendar](https://anusa.com.au/clubs/events/) allows students to see all upcoming events run by clubs and societies affiliated with ANUSA. This calendar is updated in real-time as clubs create Rubric events.
