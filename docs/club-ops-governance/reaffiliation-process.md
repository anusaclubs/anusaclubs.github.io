# Affiliation and Re-affiliation

Welcome! This guide provides all the necessary steps for both brand-new clubs wishing to affiliate with ANUSA and for existing clubs seeking to complete their annual re-affiliation.

Following these steps ensures your club meets the requirements of the ANUSA Clubs Regulations and can access funding, resources, and support.

## Affiliating a New Club
The affiliation process is broken down into two phases: first, gathering your documentation and fulfilling key requirements, and second, submitting the application online.

### Phase 1: Getting Your Ducks in a Row

Before you touch the online form, you need to complete these essential offline steps.

#### Step 1: Draft a Constitution
Your constitution is the rulebook for your club. It outlines your purpose, how you run elections, and the roles of your executives.

*   **We recommend basing your constitution on the [Model Clubs Constitution here](http://anusa.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Model-Clubs-Constitution-1-1-1.pdf).** This template is already designed to be compliant with ANUSA regulations.
*   You will need to formally pass a motion to accept this constitution at your Inaugural General Meeting (IGM).

#### Step 2: Hold an Inaugural General Meeting (IGM)
This is the first official meeting of your club and is essential for affiliation.

*   **Gather Members:** You must have at least 15 currently enrolled ANU students present.
*   **Key Tasks:** At this meeting, you must:
    1.  Elect your club's executive committee (e.g., President, Treasurer, Secretary).
    2.  Formally pass a motion to accept your club's constitution.
*   **Returning Officer (RO):** You must have an unbiased person (who is not running for a position) to act as the Returning Officer to conduct the elections fairly.
*   **Take Minutes:** You must take detailed minutes of this meeting. These minutes are a required document for both opening a bank account and for your affiliation application.

> **💡 Need help running a meeting?** You can find a guide to running General Meetings [here](./running-meetings/general-meetings.html).

#### Step 3: Open a Club Bank Account
Your club needs its own bank account to manage funds.

*   **Account Name:** The account must be opened under the club's full name.
*   **Two-to-Sign:** The account **must** be a "two-to-sign" account. This is a security measure that requires two executives to approve any transaction. Most banks offer a "Club" or "Society" account type that has this feature.
*   **What you'll need:** To open the account, the bank will typically request a physical copy of your club's constitution and the signed minutes from your IGM. The IGM minutes should contain a clear motion authorising at least three trustees (usually your President, Treasurer, and another executive) to manage the account.

> **Note:** A two-to-sign bank account is required to receive any funding from ANUSA.

#### Step 4: Get an Australian Business Number (ABN)
An ABN is a unique 11-digit number that identifies your club to the government.

*   **You can register for a free ABN online [here](https://www.abr.gov.au/business-super-funds-charities/applying-abn).**
*   **Exemption:** If your club will not be receiving any funding (e.g., a political club that cannot receive SSAF), you can be exempted from this requirement. To request an exemption, put "N/A" in the ABN field on the affiliation form and send an email to `sa.clubsofficer@anu.edu.au` explaining why you do not require funding.

### Step 5: Apply for Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) Registration (Optional)
If your club's purpose is charitable or not-for-profit, you may want to register with the ACNC. This is optional but can provide benefits like being exempt from tax.
*   **You can apply for ACNC registration [here](https://www.acnc.gov.au/for-charities/start-charity/apply).**
> **Note:** You may want to seek legal advice. [The ANUSA legal service](https://anusa.com.au/legal/legal-help-for-clubs/) are able to provide support and advice on this process. 


### Phase 2: The Online Application

Once you have completed all the steps above, you are ready to submit your application.

#### Step 5: Sign Up on QPay and Submit the Affiliation Form
ANUSA uses the Rubric platform to manage all club forms, including affiliations and grants.

1.  **Create a Club Rubric Account:** You can **[sign up for an account here](https://portal.hellorubric.com/getstarted)**.
2.  Go to the ‘Forms’ section in the navigation bar. The first form should be the ANUSA Affiliation Form.
3.  Fill out the form with the information and documents you prepared in Phase 1.

> **⚠️ Important Tip:**
> Make sure you create a **new, general email address for your club** (e.g., `anufairytalesociety@gmail.com`). Using a personal email means future club executives won't receive important emails from ANUSA.

#### Information You'll Need for the Form:

*   **Club Name & Description:** The full name of your society and what it does. Remember, your society's purpose must be unique! Check the [ANUSA Clubs list here](https://anusa.com.au/clubs/clubs-list/) to make sure another club doesn't already exist.
*   **Inaugural General Meeting Minutes:** You will need to upload a copy of your IGM minutes.
*   **Constitution:** You will need to upload a copy of your final constitution.
*   **ABN:** Your 11-digit Australian Business Number.
*   **Recent Bank Statement:** A recent statement or proof of account that shows the club's name and the account details.
*   **Bank Trustees:** The names of the three executives who are authorised to access the bank account. All trustees must be current ANU students.
*   **Membership Details:** The names and university u-numbers of at least 15 members who are current ANU students.

## Re-affiliating an Existing Club

Re-affiliation is the annual process all existing clubs must complete to remain active and eligible for funding. The process is much simpler than a new affiliation.

#### Step 1: Hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM)
*   At your AGM, you must elect your club's executive committee for the upcoming year.
*   You must take minutes of this meeting, as they are required for the re-affiliation form.
> **💡 Need help running a meeting?** You can find a guide to running General Meetings [here](./running-meetings/general-meetings.html).

#### Step 2: Gather Updated Information
*   Confirm you have a list of at least 15 members who are currently enrolled ANU students, along with their names and u-numbers.
*   Have an updated bank statement ready.

#### Step 3: Submit the Re-affiliation Form
*   Log in to your club's Rubric account.
*   Navigate to the "Forms" section and select the **Club Re-affiliation Form**.
*   Fill out the form with your newly elected executive details, your updated membership list, and your AGM minutes.

> **Note:** You do **not** need to create a new bank account or apply for a new ABN. You will simply re-submit the details you already have.
