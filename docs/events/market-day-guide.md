# Market Day Events Guide
ANUSA Market Day is the biggest event of the O-Week and Bush Week calendars. Always held on the Wednesday, Market Day is on University Avenue during O-Week and usually inside the ANU Sport Hall during Bush Week (because it's so cold outside!). All ANUSA-affiliated clubs are entitled to have a stall free-of-charge, and usually pick up a heap of members through participating.
This page steps you through preparing for Market Day.

## Before the Event

### Sign-ups and Logistics
The first step to preparing for Market Day is to let ANUSA know you'd like a stall! This is handled through a Rubric form. The Clubs Team will let clubs know well ahead of time when this form is open via email. This will close about two months before Market Day. The form requires a Club Executive to sign a Code of Conduct agreement on behalf of the club.
All external sponsorship material that will be brought to the event must also be declared. If additional sponsors are brought on after the sponsorship declaration is completed, please email the Clubs Team.

No less than a week before Market Day, clubs will receive an information pack detailing stall location, bump-in times, and bump-out times.

### Preparing Your Stall
Each club shares a 3x3 marquee with another club, with a 1.8m and 1.2m table spanning the front of the stall. Everything that your club does should be contained within your 1.5m space, because walkways need to remain clear for emergencies. Every stall has two chairs
