# Working with Functions on Campus

Planning an event at ANU often involves more than just booking a room. For many events, especially those that are outdoors, large, or involve food or alcohol, you will need to work with the university's **Functions on Campus (FoC)** team.

FoC is the central university authority responsible for ensuring all events on campus are safe, compliant, and well-managed. This guide will walk you through when you need to contact them, how the process works, and critically, how to navigate venue hire fees.

### When Do I Need a Function Application?

You are required to complete an "Application to hold a function on campus" essentially whenever you hold an event that is a bookable venue on campus. This includes Marie Reay, outdoor spaces, and similar.
However, this does not include Badger & Co, coffee shops, or other commercial venues on campus.

### The Application Process & Deadlines

1.  **Book Your Venue First:** You must have a confirmed venue booking.
    - Booking in Kambri requires approval from Kambri Venues (kambri.venues@anu.edu.au).
    - Centrally-managed teaching spaces are done through [ANU Venue Hire](https://services.anu.edu.au/campus-environment/venues-functions/anu-venue-hire).
    - BBQs and fire pits can be done through the FoC form.
    - Other venues are managed by other authorities on campus (e.g Hanna Neumann is managed by MSI Admin), so reach out to Venue Hire to get contacts.
2.  **Complete the Application Form:** Fill out the official [Application to hold a function on campus form](https://services.anu.edu.au/campus-environment/venues-functions/functions-on-campus).
3.  **Meet the Deadlines:** These deadlines are **strictly enforced**.
    *   **At least 2 WEEKS in advance** for small functions without alcohol.
    *   **At least 3 WEEKS in advance** for larger functions and/or **any event involving alcohol.**

## Understanding Venue Hire: Your Event Should Be Free

As an affiliated ANUSA Club, your events are for ANU students and should fall under **Category 2: ANU Use for Staff and Students**. The university's own policy states this category is for "regular meetings and functions that are critical to social and academic life at ANU" and that for these bookings, **venue hire fees are waived**.

You should not be charged a *base venue hire fee* for using standard ANU venues like the Marie Reay Teaching Centre (MRTC).

### Why Might My Club Get Charged?

Recently, the Venues team has begun re-categorising some club events into **Category 5: ANU Partner/Community Groups**, which comes with a significant venue hire fee.

Based on communications from the Venues team, this happens when they believe an event's scope "goes beyond Category 2." They are specifically looking for events that appear commercial or are large-scale productions, such as:

*   Conferences, exhibitions, or music festivals.
*   Events that heavily feature corporate clients, sponsors, embassies, or other external organisations.

Their concern is that external commercial entities may be using student clubs as a "back-door" to get free venue hire.

### How to Keep Your Event in Category 2

To avoid being incorrectly re-categorised, you must frame your event clearly as a student-focused activity.

*   **Do not include sponsors in your event title.** This is the biggest red flag. Mention them in the event description only.

    *   ❌ **Incorrect:** `Basket-Weaving with Acme Corp!`
    *   ✅ **Correct:** `Basket-Weaving`
        *In the description:* `We're excited to weave some baskets. Thank you to our sponsor, Acme Corp, for their support.`

*   **Focus on Student Benefit:** In all communications and forms, emphasise that the event is for ANU students and is central to your club's purpose.
*   **Be Mindful of Scope:** If your event involves high-profile external partners or is a major, conference-style event, be prepared for extra scrutiny.

### Understanding "Associated Costs"

Even when your base venue hire is free under Category 2, you may still be charged for additional services required for your event. These are not venue hire fees and are generally legitimate. They include:

*   **Extra Cleaning Fees:** may be required if you have catering in teaching spaces where food and drink are not normally permitted.
*   **Venue Supervisor Fees:** Often required for larger events that happen in the evening or on weekends.
*   **Security Fees:** If your event requires security personnel.

> ## What to Do If You Receive a Quote for Venue Hire
>
> If the Functions or Venues team sends you a quote that includes a **venue hire fee** (not just associated costs like cleaning), follow these steps:
>
> 1.  **Do not panic and do not accept the quote.**
> 2.  **Immediately forward the entire email chain and quote to the ANUSA Clubs Officer.**
>
> ANUSA will advocate on your behalf to ensure that your student-run event is correctly categorised and that you are not charged incorrectly.

### Special Cases

*   **Careers Fairs:** If planning a careers fair, run your sponsor list past **ANU Careers** first to ensure they are on the university's approved list.
*   **Kambri Theatre:** Ticketed productions in the Kambri Theatre will be charged a flat **$280 maintenance fee** for the entire show run (rehearsals are not charged). You will also need to complete a bump-in/bump-out checklist.
