# Marketing at ANU

Marketing is really important for clubs on campus to gain new members and to get a really good attendance at the events that you work so hard to organise! Marketing can seem like extra work, but it is vital to the success of the event you've worked so hard on. Marketing can really make or break your event, especially if you are relying on ticket sales for financial success. If no one knows your event is on they can't attend and marketing can be a super fun way to get creative!

You should make sure that you market your club in as many places as possible to attract new members as well as marketing individual events. If you can combine these, your club will thrive!

## Key Tips to Success
*   Finalise logistics for your event as early as possible! This should include as much information as your attendees will need on the day. This will help them decide if they actually want to go. If they don't have enough information, they'll avoid committing.
*   Start marketing as early as possible, this can include by publishing your event on Facebook and ordering posters.
*   Define a clear target audience.
*   Market as widely as you can by having as many friends and attendees sharing the event.
*   Emphasise what makes your event unique.
*   Ramp up your marketing the closer you get to your event by doing a countdown!
*   If you have a ticket or registration link make sure you put that in as many places as you can.

## Branding
Choosing a theme for your club colours or a specific theme for an event is really important to have consistent branding. If you have a specific logo or colours for your club, people will be able to recognise that it is your club that is running lots of different events. The more consistent your branding, the more likely people will recognise seeing it from different platforms. This 'image' can help sell your event as fun and unique. If you create a theme it makes doing graphics or decorating the event much more cohesive.

## Collaborations
It can be super fun to ask other clubs to advertise your events for you, and it can be a nice idea to offer to advertise their events too!

## Sounding Approachable
This will depend on the tone of the event and the audience you are seeking. You could often try using lots of emojis, creating memes or trying to do some cool graphics because these are very eye-catching.

## Accessibility
If you do use emojis, please add a description for the emojis in brackets. It's also very helpful to describe pictures and put any text in a picture written on the post as well so that text-to-speech readers can pick them up.

You should explain how accessible your event is in the description because this will help people decide to go. There is a template you should add into your event description below:

{: .note .info }
> At (Name of club) we strive to make our events as accessible as possible. There will be (food options), (based on the dietary requirements you provide when you purchase your ticket). There is (parking at event) and (transport options to event). The event venue is (accessible or not accessible), with (accessible and or unisex toilets) at the venue. If you have any accessibility requirements, please don't hesitate to email (Title and or Name of person) at (email address).

## Advertising Alcohol
ANU has rules about how liquor can be discussed and consumed which is in the ANU Liquor Statute. You can't advertise drinking alcohol as the primary purpose of your event, which must be reflected in all of your marketing. You also can't advertise the sale of alcohol at your event if it is on campus, unless you have approval from the Director of Functions and Services.

## Marketing Platforms

### Electronic Marketing

**Using Facebook**
You can use Facebook by advertising on your page and you can make an event. This can have as many details as you need to give attendees, which will make running the event on the day very easy.

**Emailing Club Members**
If your club collects the email addresses of your society you can consider sending out newsletter style emails advertising your society and your events. This should have lots of links to future events or celebrate the success of past events.

**Other Groups to Consider Contacting:**
*   ANU Schmitposting - you can only post about your event once on ANU Schmitposting
*   Any other Facebook groups that have a clear link to your target audience
*   Faces of ANU
*   On Campus
*   Events at ANU
*   ANU Schmitposting (reiteration, likely refers to general posting vs. specific event link)
*   ANUSA
*   PARSA
*   Halls of Residence

**Academic Colleges and Courses:** If you are a discipline club you could consider asking your Academic College, School, or Centre to help advertise your event. If there are any relevant courses to your society you could consider contacting the relevant course convenor/lecturer to let you advertise your event!

**Any directly relevant ANUSA Departments:** (Indigenous Department, Queer Department, Women's Department, Disability Department, Environmental Collective, ANU International Students' Department and ANU BIPOC Department)

### Physical Marketing
*   Using posters can be effective for large-scale events. Lots of postering in key spaces on campus can be a really good way of getting the word out. It's a great way of advertising, but it's often overlooked!
*   Creating merchandise for your club for people to use (like stickers) can be effective.
*   Investing in a banner to bring to events can help people recognise your club.

### Marketing at Market Day
Market Day in O-Week and Bush Week are really good opportunities for interested people to ask about being involved in your club. Some stall decorating ideas that will help you market more effectively you can consider are:
*   Banners
*   Pamphlets for people to take with them
*   Informational posters to put on your table
*   If your society has merchandise, your members manning the stall could wear it
*   Your society could also consider giving stickers or membership cards to members which helps promote your society
*   Some societies are able to demonstrate what their society does at their market day stall which can be extra engaging for potential members

## Graphics Software
There are lots of different software that you can use to help you market your event. Some you can consider include:
*   Canva (very easy)
*   Adobe InDesign
*   Inkscape

ANU has lots of software you can use for free on campus or get reduced subscriptions for which you can look at from the ANU website.
