# A Guide to ANUSA Club Funding

One of the most significant benefits of being an affiliated ANUSA club is the ability to apply for funding. This funding, derived from the Student Services and Amenities Fee (SSAF), is designed to help you run events, grow your membership, and contribute to a vibrant campus culture.

All funding applications are managed through the **Rubric platform**. This guide will walk you through the process, explain the different types of grants available, and provide tips for a successful application.

> **The Golden Rules of Funding**
>
> 1.  **The Regulations are Law:** This guide summarises the rules for convenience. The **[ANUSA Clubs Regulations](link-to-your-regulations-document)** are the definitive source of truth. If there is any inconsistency, the Regulations always prevail.
> 2.  **Check the Spending Guidelines:** Specific rules about spending caps and priorities for the current year are in the **[ANUSA Clubs Yearly Strategic Spending Guideline](./strategic-spending-guidelines.html)**. You **must** read this document before submitting an application.

### Understanding Key Funding Concepts

Before you apply, it's crucial to understand these core principles.

#### Prospective vs. Retrospective Funding
All grants are paid out **retrospectively** by default. This means your club will need to cover the cost of an event or activity first, and then apply for reimbursement from ANUSA. While some grants may be applied for **prospectively** (before the event takes place), payment is still made after the event unless an exemption is granted.

#### SSAF-Funded vs. Sponsored Pool Grants
*   **SSAF-Funded Grants:** The majority of grants (Events, Operational, etc.) come from the SSAF pool. There is a **Funding Limit** on the total amount of SSAF funding your club can receive each year.
*   **Sponsored Pool Grants:** These grants are funded by external sponsors. They have their own eligibility criteria and **do not count** towards your annual SSAF Funding Limit. The Clubs Officer will advise when these are available.

### Grant Categories

Grants are divided into two main categories: **Event Grants** for specific club events and **Operational Grants** for the day-to-day running of your club.

### Event Grants

These grants are for costs related to a specific event. Unless otherwise specified, they are decided and paid **retrospectively**.
> ⚠️ Event grants are designed to help your club break even, not make money. This means ANUSA will only fund the event up to the point where your income equals your expenses (the 'break-even limit'). If your event makes a profit (e.g. from ticket sales or sponsorship), your grant amount will be reduced accordingly.

#### Ordinary Events Grant
*   **What it's for:** This is your standard grant for most club events.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **$8 per student** attending the event, capped at a maximum of **$4,000** per event.

#### Special Annual Event Grant
*   **What it's for:** For one, extra-special event your club holds per year (e.g., a ball, conference, or annual dinner).
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **$12 per student** attending the event.
*   **Key Considerations:** Can only be used **once** per year.

#### Travel Events Grant
*   **What it's for:** Subsidising travel expenses for club activities that benefit the club, like attending a competition or conference.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **50% of all reasonable travel expenses**, capped at a maximum of **$4,000** per year.
*   **Key Considerations:** This is the only Event Grant that is approved **prospectively** (before you go). If you don't get prospective approval, you can only apply for an Ordinary Events Grant subsidy afterwards.

#### Joint Event Grant
*   **What it's for:** An event held in collaboration between two or more clubs.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **$8 per student** attending, capped at **$4,000** per event. The costs are distributed among the collaborating clubs and count towards each club's Funding Limit.
*   **Key Considerations:** You cannot also apply for an Ordinary Events Grant for the same event. If you wish to split funding amongst participating clubs in a particular way, you must specify this in the application.

#### Inclusive Events Grant
*   **What it's for:** Covering costs that make your event more inclusive and accessible. This can include the cost of a Welcome to Country, subsidising equity tickets, or other accessibility measures.
*   **Funding Details:** The amount is discretionary and decided by the Clubs Officer.
*   **Key Considerations:** This can be applied for **in addition** to any other event grant.

#### Sponsored Event Enhancement Grant
*   **What it's for:** Extra funding from the Sponsored Pool to enhance an event that meets specific sponsor criteria.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **$5 per student** attending, capped at **$1,000** per event.
*   **Key Considerations:** This does not count towards your annual SSAF Funding Limit. This is only available when indicated by the Clubs Officer, as it depends on sponsorship availability.

### Operational Grants

These grants are for non-event costs that support the smooth running of your club. They are decided **prospectively** (before you spend) but paid **retrospectively**.

#### Ordinary Operational Grant
*   **What it's for:** Funding for necessary operational costs not covered by other grants.
*   **Funding Details:** Discretionary, capped at **$300**.

#### Capital Expenditure Grant
*   **What it's for:** Purchasing physical assets (e.g. packs of cards, projector) for the club.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **100% of the purchase price**, capped at **$1,000** per year.
*   **Key Considerations:** Items are the property of the club, not individuals. You will need to provide quotes in the grant application form.

#### Merchandise Grant
*   **What it's for:** Subsidising the cost of club-branded merchandise to be sold or distributed to members.
*   **Funding Details:** Up to **50% of the purchase price**, capped at **$1,000** per year. Make sure to read the Strategic Spending Guidelines to understand the types of merchandise that is eligible.

#### Club Startup Grant
*   **What it's for:** A one-time grant to help newly affiliated clubs get on their feet.
*   **Funding Details:** A flat **$200** grant.
*   **Key Considerations:** Only available to clubs that have newly affiliated in the current academic year and have less than $500 in their bank account.

#### Club Handover Grant
*   **What it's for:** A reward for completing the official ANUSA Clubs Handover Checklist.
*   **Funding Details:** A flat **$50** grant, acquitted during the re-affiliation process.

#### In-Kind Sponsorship Grant
*   **What it's for:** To formally recognise non-monetary support from a sponsor (e.g., providing free goods or services).
*   **Funding Details:** The value is determined by the fair market value of the contribution.
*   **Key Considerations:** This does not involve a monetary transfer and does not count towards your SSAF Funding Limit. Like the Sponsored Event Enhancement Grant, this is only available when indicated by the Clubs Officer, as it depends on sponsorship availability.

### What You *Cannot* Fund (Prohibited Expenditure)

SSAF funding has strict rules. You **cannot** use grant money for:
*   Donations, sponsorships, or scholarships.
*   Alcohol or tobacco.
*   Cash, vouchers, or any form of currency.
*   Paying off debts.
*   Most affiliation fees to other organisations.
*   Honoraria or stipends (paying people for their time).
*   Items that will become the personal property of members (except club-branded merchandise).
